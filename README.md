  Baldwin's Books was a fully functioning Laravel e-commerce site I helped create in a team with 2 other students. The project lasted about 2 weeks and I was really proud of the way it turned out. It is definitely my best work in PHP and the MEAN stack so far. You can check out a demo of this application [here]( https://youtu.be/F7EI7WzmjQY).
